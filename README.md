## delete-all-chapters-of-user.js
This deletes all chapters of a user on the current page. After pasting it into the browser-console it will ask you which user's chapters you want to nuke. You will need to fill in the url of the user. Your user-url will be the default. Make sure you do have the permissions to delete them.

## mangadex-uploader.sh
A primitive bash-script to upload a single chapter to mangadex. For help how to use it, simply execute it without arguments.
An improved version for bulk-uploads written in NodeJS can be found [here](https://github.com/xicelord/mangadex-bulkuploader).
